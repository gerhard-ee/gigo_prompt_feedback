This project provides a collection of tools and examples for evaluating and improving AI prompts. It includes interactive feedback pages and examples of good vs. bad prompts to help users understand how to write more effective prompts.

## Contents

- `prompt_feedback.html`: Interactive page for getting feedback on your prompts
- `good_vs_bad_prompt.html`: Examples comparing effective and ineffective prompts
- `infographic.html`: Visual guide for prompt engineering best practices

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gerhard-ee/gigo_prompt_feedback.git
cd gigo_prompt_feedback
```

2. Open any of the HTML files in your web browser to view the content.
